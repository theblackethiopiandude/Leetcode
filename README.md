# LeetCode Optimization

```cpp
auto init = []() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);
    return 'c';
}();
```

This code snippet is typically used to optimize input and output operations where performance is critical. Here's how each part contributes to the optimization:


### Disabling Synchronization `ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` :
#### Purpose: Speeds up I/O operations.
**Explanation:** By default, C++ standard streams (cin, cout) are synchronized with C standard streams (scanf, printf). Disabling this synchronization allows C++ streams to operate independently, resulting in faster I/O operations because there's no need to ensure the C++ streams' state matches the C streams' state.


### Untying Streams `cin.tie(nullptr)` , `cout.tie(nullptr)`:
#### Purpose: Further speeds up input operations.
**Explanation:** By default, cin is tied to cout, which means cout is flushed (i.e., its buffer is written to the output) before any input operation using cin. Untying them prevents this automatic flushing, reducing unnecessary output operations and thus improving performance, especially when frequent input and output operations are performed.


#### Practical Benefits
**Reduced Latency:** Faster input and output operations reduce the time spent on I/O, which can be crucial in performance-critical applications.
Improved Throughput: The program can handle more I/O operations per unit of time, making it more efficient, particularly in data-intensive tasks.
